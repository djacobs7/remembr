#fixme:

1) get a list of all loaded packages
2) if there is an error due to undefined function; then define the functiona nd continue
3) make sure library only gets called int ehe current namespace


TODO:

1) Write a blog post about a specific package (or talk )
2) consider creating a card-pack for that talk
3) consider making it so cards actually have code associated with them
4) fix it so the flashcards dont delete themselves if you have another R running.
5) add more tests


How could the shared database work

1) we could use sql light - an actual shared database
2)
  a) we could suffix the written file with a pid
  b) on read ( which only happens on startup ), we read from all files suffixed with a pid.   we merge into a file for the current pid, cleanup existing .pid files, and write to a shared root.
  c) on startup

3)  on startup
  write a pidfile

  on write:
    check the last modified time of the shared rds file

    is it greater than the last known write that this process is aware of?

    if so, then don't write!
